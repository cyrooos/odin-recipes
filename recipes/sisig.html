    <h3>Authentic Sisig</h3>
    <p>
        Pork sisig is a popular Filipino dish. It can be considered as a main dish or an appetizer. The composition of 
        this dish is mainly of pig’s parts such as minced pork meat, ears, and face. Chicken liver, onions, and chili peppers are also added.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dish's name comes from “sisigan,” an old Tagalog word which means “to make it sour.” Its existence was first 
        recorded in a Kapampangan dictionary back in 1732 by Diego Bergaño, a Spanish missionary who served as the parish priest for Mexico, Pampanga at the time.
