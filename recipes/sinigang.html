    <h3>Authentic Pork Sinigang</h3>
    <p>Sinigang is a tamarind-based soup that is known for its sour and savory
        taste. You can make it with either fish, pork belly, spare ribs or corned
        beef. My favorite is with pork spare ribs, lots of veggies, and a bed of
        rice.

    <p>Sinigang is a dish originated in the Philippines. Typically, it is composed of fish,
        meat, vegetables, tomatoes and tamarind flavoring. The reason why it is called
        “sinigang” is that it was a translation to the English word, “stew” which is true
        because of its method of cooking.
